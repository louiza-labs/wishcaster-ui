      Here are some examples to follow:
       1. if a request is about 'AMA Frames', it should be categorized under the 'Frames' category. 
       2. if a request is about 'browser extensions', it should be categorized under the 'Extensions' category.
       3. if a request is about 'grant programs', it should be categorized under the 'Grants' category
